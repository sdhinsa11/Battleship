This is a Battleship projected created in terms of the Odin Project. 

This is a one player game as a human-player plays against a computer. As soon as you enter your name and pick the randomized placements for your ship the game will commence.
After the user takes there turn the computer will shortly follow and the game will end once a player hits the opposing player battleships. The computer uses randomized turns 
in order to pick a place on the player game board. After the game as ended the user as a choice in order to replay against the computer using the same name or restart the game 
entirely bringing the user back to the main screen. 

What I learned:
- How to incorporate a computer turn
- Introducing random placement with choosing ships 
- Wrote tests in Jest to test the Ship class, Player class, Gameboard class


Areas for improvement:
- Include levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) where the computer is an AI thus determining the levels
- Allow users to drag and drop there ships
- Modifying the dom code into a design pattern (such as IIFEs) or practicing OOP principles on it 

These improvements will be implemented shortly. 

Enjoy the Game!!
